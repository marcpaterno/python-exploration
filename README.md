# python-exploration

This is a repository for Python code snippets that I have used to demonstrate
something to myself. It is not likely to be of interest to many others.

## Requirements

This repository expects several Python modules to be available.
For testing and code hygiene, I rely upon several tools.
The following `conda` command will create an environment containing all the requirements.

    mamba create -c conda-forge -n testing black cxx-compiler flake8 mypy numpy pybind11 pylint pytest
